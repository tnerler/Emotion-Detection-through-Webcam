## Features  
- **Live Webcam Integration:** Detects emotions directly from webcam feed.  
- **Preprocessing:** Frames are preprocessed for better model performance.  
- **Model Training:** Trained on an emotion dataset to classify different emotions.  
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Displays predicted emotions in real-time.
